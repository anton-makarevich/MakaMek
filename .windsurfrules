 src/MakaMek.Core/        : Core game engine and logic
 src/MakaMek.Avalonia/    : UI implementation with AvaloniaUI v11

3. Do not modify code right away, help with brainstorming and suggestions first

4. If you have any doubts - always ask, do not make assumptions

5. Never modify any code that is not related to your current task, if you see any gaps - suggest to improve, but don't modify
