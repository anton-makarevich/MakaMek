1. Workspace structure:
 src/MekForge.Core/        : Core game engine and logic
 src/MekForge.Avalonia/    : UI implementation with AvaloniaUI v11
 tests/                    : Unit tests

2. Unit tests are run with xUnit, NSubstitute for mocking, Shouldly for assertions

3. Do not modify code right away, help with brainstorming and suggestions first

4. If you have any doubts - always ask, do not make assumptions

5. Never modify any code that is not related to your current task, if you see any gaps - suggest to improve, but don't modify
