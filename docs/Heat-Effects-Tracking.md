### Heat Effects Checklist
Version: **0.42.x**

#### 1. Heat Related Shutdown

* [ ] Mech attempts to shutdown at 14, 18, 22, 26 and 30 heat points (**Heat Effects**).
* [ ] A conscious MechWarrior can override the power plant’s safety shutdown procedure, as indicated by the Avoid number listed with the effect, though shutdown cannot be avoided at 30 or more heat points
* [ ] When the heat drops below 14 on the Heat Scale, the power plant restarts automatically at **Heat Phase**, even if the pilot is out of action.
* [ ] A player may elect to voluntarily shut down a mech during any **End Phase** 
* [ ] A player can attempt to restart the mech at next turn's **End Phase**.

#### 2. Heat-triggered Ammunition Explosions

* [ ] If the heat level reaches or exceeds an Ammo Explosion thresh old of 19, 23, or 28 heat points, the ammunition a ’Mech carries may explode.
* [ ] The explosion can be avoided by pure luck, as indicated by the Avoid number. 
* [ ] When an overheated ’Mech’s ammo explodes, the ammunition critical slot with the most destructive ammo per shot explodes first. All of the appropriate ammo type in a single critical slot explodes.
* [ ] If more than one critical hit slot holds  the appropriate ammo type, the one with the most shots remain ing explodes. If two or more locations have an equal number of shots remaining, randomly determine which one explodes.
