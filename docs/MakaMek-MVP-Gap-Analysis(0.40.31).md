## Priority Recommendations

### **P0 - Critical for MVP (Immediate)**

1. **Complete Heat Management System**
   - Implement movement penalties at heat thresholds
   - Add weapon accuracy penalties
   - Implement shutdown risk mechanics
   - Add ammunition explosion risks

2. **Fix Jump Movement Heat**
   - Ensure jump heat is properly applied to heat scale
   - Verify heat effects trigger correctly

## Testing Requirements

### Critical Test Cases Needed

1. **Heat Management Tests**
   - Verify movement penalties at each heat threshold
   - Test weapon accuracy penalties
   - Validate shutdown roll mechanics
   - Test ammunition explosion scenarios

2. **Movement System Tests**
   - Verify jump heat application

3. **Critical Hit Tests**
   - Test cockpit destruction scenarios
   - Test sensor damage effects

## Conclusion

The MakaMek project has achieved approximately **80% completion** of the MVP requirements. The foundation is solid with excellent architecture, comprehensive testing, and good separation of concerns. The missing features are well-defined and implementable within the existing architecture.

**Key Strengths:**
- Excellent technical architecture
- Comprehensive MTF format support
- Solid multiplayer foundation
- Good test coverage for implemented features

**Critical Blockers for MVP:**
- Heat management system incomplete
- Jump movement heat not applied
- Critical hit effects missing

The project is well-positioned for rapid completion of the remaining MVP features due to its solid architectural foundation and comprehensive existing test suite.
