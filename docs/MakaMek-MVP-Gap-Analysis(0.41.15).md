## Testing Requirements

### Critical Test Cases Needed

1. **Heat Management Tests**
   - Verify shutdown roll mechanics at each threshold
   - Test heat-triggered ammunition explosion scenarios
   - Validate exact penalty thresholds match PRD

2. **Critical Hit Integration Tests**
   - Test cockpit destruction scenarios
   - Test sensor damage progression
   - Test ammunition explosion cascading effects

## Conclusion

The MakaMek project has achieved approximately **85% completion** of the MVP requirements, representing significant progress from the previous 75% completion at version 0.40.31. The major additions of critical hit effects, pilot consciousness systems, aimed shots, and improved heat management have substantially enhanced the game's completeness.

**Key Achievements Since 0.40.31:**
- Complete critical hit effects system
- Full pilot consciousness and injury mechanics
- Comprehensive aimed shots implementation
- Major heat management improvements
- Enhanced component explosion mechanics

**Remaining Critical Blockers for MVP:**
- Heat-triggered shutdown mechanics
- Heat-triggered ammunition explosions
- Minor heat penalty threshold alignment

The project is now very close to MVP completion, with only specific heat management mechanics remaining to be implemented. The solid architectural foundation continues to support rapid development of the remaining features.
