**MakaMek** MVP targets the set of rules described in this document.
This document focuses on a simplified set of rules for BattleMechs, using equipment primarily from the 3025 era (Succession Wars) and basic terrain types like clear and woods, without incorporating complex levels or physical attacks.

### BattleMechs: The Core Units

BattleMechs are classified by weight:
*   **Light 'Mechs**: Weighing 20 to 35 tons, these are primarily used for reconnaissance due to their speed and jump capability, allowing them to avoid heavy fighting and assess enemy formations. However, they rarely stand up against heavier units.
*   **Medium 'Mechs**: Ranging from 40 to 55 tons, these are the workhorses of Inner Sphere armies, forming the core of most units. They engage in combat with opposing troops until heavier units arrive.
*   **Heavy 'Mechs**: Weighing 60 to 75 tons, these are often piloted by commanders and experienced MechWarriors. They can both inflict and withstand significant damage, making them formidable opponents.
*   **Assault 'Mechs**: At 80 to 100 tons, these are considered the kings of the battlefield in the 31st century. A single Assault 'Mech can often equal an entire lance of lighter 'Mechs.

BattleMechs come in two primary chassis configurations: the more common **bipedal (humanoid)** design and a **four-legged (quad)** design. When referring to 'Mechs in this document, the term "’Mech" includes bipedal BattleMechs only.

### Game Components
To play BattleTech, players will require dice, maps, and miniatures or counters to represent BattleMechs.
*   **Dice**: BattleTech uses **two six-sided dice**. When the rules indicate "1D6," you roll one die; for "2D6," you roll both dice and add the results.
*   **Mapsheets**: The game is played on 18-by-22 inch mapsheets divided into **six-sided hexes** (hexagons). Each hex represents an area 30 meters across. For this simplified game, we will only use mapsheets with **clear** and **woods** terrain.
    *   **Clear Terrain**: Represents fields, meadows, and grasslands where the ground is firm. If a hex is not marked otherwise, assume it is clear.
    *   **Light Woods**: Covered with sparse trees up to twelve meters tall. Most units cannot cross this terrain as easily as clear terrain. Line of sight may pass through light woods.
    *   **Heavy Woods**: Covered with denser trees that provide more cover.
*   **Record Sheets**: Players use unique 'Mech Record Sheets to track information like damage, internal heat buildup, and equipped weapons.

### Playing the Game
BattleTech simulates combat in discrete turns, with each turn representing ten seconds of real time.
The game proceeds through several phases in a specific sequence:
1.  **Initiative Phase**: Both players roll 2D6, and the player with the higher result wins Initiative for that turn.
2.  **Movement Phase (Ground)**: Players alternate moving their BattleMechs. The player with Initiative moves first. Each time it is a player's turn to move a 'Mech, they must announce its movement mode or declare it is staying still. Movement alternates until all 'Mechs have moved.
3.  **Weapon Attack Phase**: All weapon attacks are declared and then resolved.
4.  **Heat Phase**: Players calculate and adjust their 'Mechs' heat levels.
5.  **End Phase**: Miscellaneous actions are resolved, and the turn ends.

The game continues with these phases until one team meets its victory conditions, typically by eliminating all opposing 'Mechs.

#### MechWarriors: The Human Element
The soldiers who pilot BattleMechs are called MechWarriors. For game purposes, MechWarriors possess two key skills: **Piloting Skill** and **Gunnery Skill**. A lower skill rating indicates a better warrior.
*   **Piloting Skill**: Represents a MechWarrior's ability to control their 'Mech's movements, including keeping it upright.
*   **Gunnery Skill**: Represents a MechWarrior's ability to accurately aim and fire weapons.

MechWarriors can take up to 5 points of damage before being killed; the sixth point of damage is fatal. Damage to a MechWarrior can occur from head hits, falling, internal ammunition explosions, or excessive heat buildup if the 'Mech's life support is damaged.

### Movement
During the Movement Phase, BattleMechs can move in one of two modes:
*   **Walking**: The standard movement mode for BattleMechs.
*   **Running**: Allows for greater speed but can incur a higher to-hit modifier for the moving 'Mech.
*   **Jumping**: Mechs` can use jump jets to move without terrain penalties and gain a Target Movement Modifier (TMM).

**Movement Basics**:
*   To enter any hex, a 'Mech spends 1 Movement Point (MP).
*   Entering **Clear terrain** costs +0 MP.
*   Entering **Light Woods** costs +1 MP.
*   Entering **Heavy Woods** costs +2 MP.
*   A 'Mech can also change its **facing** (the direction its feet are pointing) at a cost of 1 MP per hexside (60 degrees).

**Piloting Skill Rolls (Simplified)**:
MechWarriors may need to make Piloting Skill Rolls to avoid falling in certain circumstances, such as when their 'Mech takes significant damage. The base Piloting Skill is modified by various factors. If a Piloting Skill Roll is failed, the 'Mech falls, taking damage, and the MechWarrior may also be injured.

### Combat: Weapon Attacks
All attacks are declared before any are resolved. A 'Mech has different **firing arcs** (Forward, Left Side, Right Side, Rear) depending on where its weapons are mounted. A 'Mech can also **torso twist** to shift its upper body's firing arc, allowing it to fire at targets to its left or right.
  
**Line of Sight (LOS)**: Must exist between attacker and target. Determined by drawing a line between hex centres and considering intervening terrain (levels, woods, buildings, partial cover).

**Firing Arcs**: Weapons have defined firing arcs (Forward, Left Side, Right Side, Rear). `Mechs` can perform a **torso twist** to change their forward arc (except quads). Turreted vehicles can rotate turrets. Arms can be reversed to fire rearwards.

**To-Hit Roll Calculation (GATOR)**: A **2D6 roll** must equal or exceed a **Modified To-Hit Number** for an attack to succeed.
**Base To-Hit Number**: Equal to the attacking unit's Gunnery Skill rating.
**Modifiers (Cumulative)**:
*   **Attacker Movement Modifier**: Based on attacker's movement mode (walking/cruising, running/flanking, jumping).
*   **Target Movement Modifier**: Based on the number of hexes the target moved.
*   **Range Modifier**: Based on distance to target (Short, Medium, Long, Extreme).
*   **Minimum Range Modifier**: Penalty if target is within a weapon's minimum range.
*   **Terrain Modifiers**: For intervening terrain, partial cover.
*   **Heat/Damage Modifiers**: From attacker's heat buildup or critical damage.
*   **Multiple Target Modifier**: If attacker fires at multiple targets.

**Aimed Shots**: Special rules for targeting specific locations on immobile or active units.

**Ammunition**: Limited for missile and ballistic weapons. Tracked on Critical Hit Table slots. Can be dumped.

**Hit Location**: On a successful hit, roll 2D6 on the appropriate Hit Location Table (unit-specific) to determine where the damage lands. Attack direction (front, side, rear) can influence the table used.

**Damage Resolution**: Applied first to **Armor** (circles on record sheet). Remaining damage transfers to **Internal Structure** (circles). If internal structure is destroyed, damage can transfer to the next inward location based on the Damage Transfer Diagram.

**Critical Damage**:
When a 'Mech's internal structure takes damage, there's a chance for a **critical hit**. The attacking player rolls 2D6 to determine the number of critical hits. Critical hits can disable or destroy specific components within the 'Mech. Key critical hit effects include:
*   **Cockpit (Head)**: A critical hit to the cockpit destroys the slot, kills the MechWarrior, and puts the 'Mech out of commission.
*   **Engine (Torso)**: Fusion engines have 3 points of shielding. Each critical hit destroys 1 point, increasing heat. Three engine hits destroy the 'Mech.
*   **Gyro (Torso)**: Each critical hit to the gyro adds modifiers to Piloting Skill Rolls. A destroyed gyro causes the 'Mech to fall automatically and renders it immobile.
*   **Heat Sinks**: Each critical hit destroys a heat sink, reducing the 'Mech's ability to dissipate heat.
*   **Sensors (Head)**: Critical hits to sensors add to-hit modifiers for the 'Mech's weapon attacks. A second hit prevents the 'Mech from firing weapons.

**Destroying a Unit**:
A BattleMech is considered **destroyed** and out of the game if its MechWarrior dies, it suffers three engine hits, or its head, cockpit, or centre torso are destroyed.

### Heat
BattleMechs generate **heat points** from movement and weapon fire. This internal heat is tracked on the 'Mech's Heat Scale on the record sheet.
*   **Building Up Heat**: Heat is generated by walking (+1 per turn), running (+2 per turn), and firing weapons (variable per weapon).
*   **Effects of Heat**: Excessive heat negatively impacts a 'Mech's performance.
    *   **Movement**: At certain heat levels (5, 10, 15, 20, 25), the 'Mech's Walking MP is reduced.
    *   **Weapon Attacks**: At heat levels of 4, 8, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29+, a modifier is added to the 'Mech's to-hit numbers.
    *   **Shutdown**: At heat levels of 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, a 'Mech automatically attempts to shut down its power plant as a safety measure, becoming immobile and unable to attack until restarted.
    *   **Ammunition**: If heat reaches or exceeds 19, 23, or 28 points, ammunition may explode, damaging the MechWarrior.
    *   **Damage to MechWarriors**: If life-support systems are critically hit, the MechWarrior takes damage at heat levels of 15 or more.
